Welcome to Py4Science at the Vienna Biocenter
=============================================

The Python language is an excellent tool for scientific computing and rapidly growing in popularity.
It is easy to read, easy to write and it features a great selection of powerful libraries.

Py4Science VBC (Vienna Bio Center) is a bi-monthly meeting series
facilitating cross-pollination between interested parties who use
Python as part of their scientific tool set. Those wishing to attend
do not need to be expert at python programming, but familiarity with
the language and some popular libraries such as numpy and matplotlib
is encouraged. Even if you are a complete beginner the talks will be
short (15 minutes) followed by interactive discussions and
demonstrations so you will not be bored.

**interfacing with native code from python**

  John Stowers

  Friday, 13 April 2012, 12:30pm, GMI Orange Seminar Room (room 9.36)

  There are many ways to integrate with native code (i.e. C/C++ libraries)
  from python; ctypes, cython/pyrex, swig, native python modules, etc.
  Each method has different trade-offs in terms of performance, maintainability
  and extensibility. I will discus these trade-offs and give strategies for
  wrapping object orientated and performance critical native code.

**structured arrays in numpy**

  Numpy's structured arrays are a hybrid between a bare numpy array
  (just a bunch of numbers) and table in which each column has a name
  and particular data type. As a data container, they allow
  self-documenting massive amounts of data and are becoming
  increasingly used as an interchange format for reading and writing
  CSV files, HDF5 files, and performing R-like DataFrame analysis
  (with the Pandas library).


**15 short python programs in 15 minutes**

  `source code here <https://github.com/strawlab/py4science-vbc/tree/master/week1>`_

  A whirldwind tour of the capabilities of python, the python standard library, and common
  python modules including numpy, matplotlib and opencv. We will show you how to read and
  write common files, perform analysis of images, audio, and numerical data, plot the results,
  talk to lab equipment, and much more.

Future Talks

* Plotting in matplotlib

* NumPy for MATLAB programmers

* The Zen of Python

* Interfacing to native code from Python
