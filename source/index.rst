Welcome to Py4Science at the Vienna Biocenter
=============================================

The Python language is an excellent tool for scientific computing and rapidly growing in popularity.
It is easy to read, easy to write and it features a great selection of powerful libraries.

The Py4Science is a bi-monthly, short, interactive series demonstrating the awesomeness of Python in
science and facilitating cross-pollination between interested parties.
Those wishing to attend do not need to be expert at python programming, but familiarity with
the language and some popular libraries such as numpy and matplotlib is encouraged. Even if you
are a complete beginner the talks will be short (15 minutes) followed by interactive discussions
and demonstrations so you will not be bored.

A virtual machine featuring all the necessary software will be provided. You can download this
from here.
