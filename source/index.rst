Welcome to Py4Science at the Vienna Biocenter
=============================================

The Python language is an excellent tool for scientific computing and rapidly growing in popularity.
It is easy to read, easy to write and it features a great selection of powerful libraries.

The Py4Science is a bi-monthly, short, interactive series demonstrating the awesomeness of Python in
science and facilitating cross-pollination between interested parties.
Those wishing to attend do not need to be expert at python programming, but familiarity with
the language and some popular libraries such as numpy and matplotlib is encouraged. Even if you
are a complete beginner the talks will be short (15 minutes) followed by interactive discussions
and demonstrations so you will not be bored.

  A whirldwind tour of the capabilities of python, the python standard library, and common
  python modules including numpy, matplotlib and opencv. We will show you how to read and
  write common files, perform analysis of images, audio, and numerical data, plot the results,
  talk to lab equipment, and much more.

Future Talks
------------

* Plotting in matplotlib

* NumPy for MATLAB programmers

* The Zen of Python

* Interfacing to native code from Python
